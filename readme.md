###**Welcome to the Moose Pirates Repository!**

This is the design space for our upcoming project, the MooseNews plugin and mobile application.

It aims to add personalised news articles to your home page using key words that can be shared with friends.

**Introduction**

The average person is bombarded with articles and clickbaits when they attempt to find news, most of which bears no relevance or interest to them. MooseNews is a plugin to Google Chrome that offers a personalised collaborative news experience for the future. It transforms your New Tab page into a personal hub of information with convenient links to your commonly used services. The news MooseNews provides is based on keywords you enter at any time in order to fully personalise the news displayed. MooseNews also provides a social experience through a friends network where you can find the key interest areas of all your friends to see what they're interested in, as well as share your interests with them.

**Concept**

Every person has their own personal tastes and areas of interest when it comes to what items of news they seek out. These interests can be very specific and difficult to find articles on. For example, if someone has a favourite director, the plugin will immediately display recent articles about their achievements without having to sift through pages of unrelated entertainment news. They simply choose their key areas of interest, and articles about these topics would be immediately displayed in their browser.

The web application is designed to act as a homepage, so it will take the main stage in a new tab page. Obviously people use their browsers for more than news, so their commonly used services such as YouTube and Facebook will also be featured as links on the page. 

The mobile application is an app that displays articles of key interest to the user. When breaking news relating to these key interests is released an alert will be displayed on their phone, informing them to look at the app. 

Both applications are designed with the intention of bringing the news that specifically interests a user, as efficiently as possible without the need for them to waste time and energy searching for it.

Friendships are usually based on mutual interests. Keeping this in mind, MooseNews allows for users to register friends and see their key interests so they can be shared between users. This way users will be able to stay informed about topics that are of particular interest to their friends and use this as a platform to have well-informed conversations or even purchase gifts that are particularly tailored to their friends’ interests.  

Moose News will also be linked to social media to enhance the experience for their users. For example, Moose News can pull a user’s key interests from Facebook by looking at the pages they have ‘liked’. This will save the user time they would otherwise spend thinking through which topics to subscribe to.

Another way to integrate social media is to make it easy for users to share articles they feel are interesting. This can be done by dragging the articles from the main section of the page and dropping them onto the social media icons to the right of the page. This will facilitate convenient and simple sharing of articles on social media.

####**The Team**

Nick Cassidy
Samuel Buckley
Gareth Seeto
Zaim Rashdan

**Leader**: Nick
**Logistics**: Gareth

**How will decisions be made?**
Decisions will be made with a majority vote. In the event of a tie, see the following section, as it is then considered a conflict.

**How will the team handle poor performance and resolve conflicts?**
Bo5's of rock paper scissors will be used in order to settle and conflict that may erupt. In the event of a tie, 
the offended group member should acquire pistols and a duel will be held the next applicable dawn.

Poor performance will be considered, and appropriate action will be taken. This will be initially dealt with in-group, but repeat offenders will be reported to course staff.

**Conflict Resolution**

 1. We will stay calm and give encouragement.
 2. We will identify the problems among the team members.
 3. We will seek to understand their problems.
 4. We will watch out for emotional triggers amongst the team members.
 5. We will try to come out with a solution that could satisfies all
    team members
 6. We will affirm, forgive and thank to acknowledge each member for
    their hard work in trying to work things out

If we cannot obtain a mutual understanding to solve our conflicts as a team, 

 1. We will inform the tutor about about our team’s situation
 2. We will seek advice from the tutor.
 3. We will try to come out a solution with the advice given.

If continuous effort of solving the conflict within the team and seeking advice from tutor/course coordinator does not make any progress, the final decision will be made by scrum master in neutral position.


**Communications**: Where and when will your team meet and how will you all communicate?1
Where will files be stored and shared? What are the file naming conventions?
Identify the social platform/s your team has adopted and explain the choice. How will it facilitate
communication and / or file sharing?

The team will meet both during the P02 session on Friday afternoons, with extra meetings scheduled as required.

Files will be shared through <i class = "icon-provider-gdrive"></i> Google Drive. There are no naming conventions as of yet (FIX THIS).


A Facebook group has been created, to be used for general communication across the semester.

**Plan**: Identify the key tasks that need to be completed and when. Identify:

!!**ERROR**!! This section is a __Pain__. 
(Sections represented by the keyword __Pain__ will be  written by Gareth.) 

• Project phases e.g. research; requirements; design; construction;
• Key deliverables for each phase (Milestones) ;
• Resources – equipment or other tools/people you might need.

**Tags**: Tag your proposed idea with 5 key concepts from social and mobile lectures (e.g.
awareness, Collaboration, CSCW) and 2 keywords related to journalism and News (e.g. Citizen
Journalists, ...). I've no idea how we would tag this stuff.
