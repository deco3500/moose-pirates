###Welcome to the Moose Pirates Repository!

This is the design space for our upcoming project, which will only be 85% useless.

It aims to make your web browsing experience with news content to be a little bit more dodgy than you had initially anticipated.

####Format
We’ve outlined a suggested structure for your proposal below. You are free to adapt this or use an
alternate structure:

**Introduction**: What is your project and what dilemma does it aim to address.

The average person is bombarded with articles and clickbaits when they attempt to find news, most of which bears no relevance or interest to them. **MooseNews** is a plugin to Google Chrome that offers a personalised collaborative news experience for the future. It transforms your New Tab page into a personal hub of information with convenient links to your commonly used services. The news MooseNews provides is based on keywords you enter at any time, in order to fully personalise the news you receive. MooseNews also provides a social experience via the addition of a friends network where you can find the key interest areas of all your friends to see what they're interested in, as well as share your interests with them.

**Concept**: outline the idea and the rationale behind it. Define the project aims and audience and
identify how your idea is different from / improves upon other current offerings.

Every person has their own personal tastes and areas of interest when it comes to what items of news they seek out. These interests can be very specific and can require one to search through a lot of irrelevant news in order to locate the news that’s important to them.  If a person has a favourite director for example, how will they find out whether that director is doing a new movie. They can laboriously look through all the entertainment news or they could google the director.  Moose News (MN) aims to solve this issue by providing news that is important and directly relevant to the user without the need to go searching for it. A user would choose their key areas of interest and, articles about these topics would be displayed to the them via the application.

The web application is designed to act as a homepage, so that as soon as the Users’ launch their browser they are able to view their news immediately without the need to search for it. If they launch the browser with a specific task in mind we will provide them with key links to their most used pages; this will ensure that the page can act as a functional homepage. 

The Mobile application is an app that displays articles of key interest to the User as soon as they open it. If there is breaking news relating to a User’s key interests then an alert will be displayed on the User’s phone, informing them to look at the app. 

Both these applications are designed with the intention of bringing the news, that specifically interests a user, as efficiently as possible without the need for them to waste time and energy searching for it.

Friendships are usually relationships based on mutual interests. Keeping this in mind, Moose News allows for Users to link to their friends’ key interests and to see the articles and stories that are of interest to them. This way Users will be able to stay informed about topics that are of particular interest to their friends and use this as a platform to have well-informed conversations or even purchase gifts that are particularly tailored to their friends’ interests.  

Moose News will be linked to social media to enhance the experience for their Users. One example of this is how we intend to link it to Facebook. Moose News will pull a User’s key interests from Facebook by looking at the pages a User has ‘liked’. This will not only save a User from having to enter all of their key interests, it will save the User time. 

The other way to integrate social media is to make it easy for Users to share articles they feel are interesting. This will be done by dragging the articles from the main section of the page and dropping them onto the social media icons to the right of the page. This will make the sharing of articles on social media seamless and easy.

**Team**: Who is on your team, what are their responsibilities, and how will you work together? List all
the members and their course code. Identify:

**Leader**: Nick
**Logistics**: Gareth
**Key Roles**: Key Roles are dumb.

**How will decisions be made?**
Decisions will be made with a majority vote. In the event of a tie, see the following section, as it is then considered a conflict.

**How will the team handle poor performance and resolve conflicts?**
Bo5's of rock paper scissors will be used in order to settle and conflict that may erupt. In the event of a tie, 
the offended group member should acquire pistols and a duel will be held the next applicable dawn.

Poor performance will be considered, and appropriate action will be taken. This will be initially dealt with in-group, but repeat offenders will be reported to course staff.

How we will resolve conflicts: 

 1. We will stay calm and give encouragement.
 2. We will identify the problems among the team members.
 3. We will seek to understand their problems.
 4. We will watch out for emotional triggers amongst the team members.
 5. We will try to come out with a solution that could satisfies all
    team    members
 6. We will affirm, forgive and thank to acknowledge each member for
    their hard work in trying to work things out

If we cannot obtain a mutual understanding to solve our conflicts as a team, 

 1. We will inform the tutor about about our team’s situation
 2. We will seek advice from the tutor.
 3. We will try to come out a solution with the advice given.

If continuous effort of solving the conflict within the team and seeking advice from tutor/course coordinator does not make any progress, the final decision will be made by scrum master in neutral position.


**Communications**: Where and when will your team meet and how will you all communicate?1
Where will files be stored and shared? What are the file naming conventions?
Identify the social platform/s your team has adopted and explain the choice. How will it facilitate
communication and / or file sharing?

The team will meet both during the P02 session on Friday afternoons, with extra meetings scheduled as required.

Files will be shared through Google Drive. There are no naming conventions as of yet (FIX THIS).

A Facebook group has been created, to be used for general communication across the semester.

**Plan**: Identify the key tasks that need to be completed and when. Identify:

!!**ERROR**!! This section is a __Pain__. 
(Sections represented by the keyword __Pain__ will be  written by Gareth.) 

• Project phases e.g. research; requirements; design; construction;
• Key deliverables for each phase (Milestones) ;
• Resources – equipment or other tools/people you might need.

**Tags**: Tag your proposed idea with 5 key concepts from social and mobile lectures (e.g.
awareness, Collaboration, CSCW) and 2 keywords related to journalism and News (e.g. Citizen
Journalists, ...). I've no idea how we would tag this stuff.
